# Messages

## Overview

This project is a messaging app built with PHP 8, using MySQL for the database. \
Once you create your account and log in, you can add friends, create groups, and chat with them. \
The only downside to this well-functioning system is that you need to refresh the page to see new messages, due to the **lack of real-time notifications** and the nature of pure PHP.

> *Note: The interface of this project is responsive, making it fully usable on smartphones.*

This project is **deployed** and **accessible** at the following address: [`https://messages.pifpafdeluxe.fr/`](https://messages.pifpafdeluxe.fr/). \
I **recommend** not using a password you frequently use or your real email address (a fake one works perfectly fine) due to the ***low security*** of this site. \
Feel free to add me as a friend and send me messages; maybe I'll reply one day. My username on this site is *Alexis Larose* :)
